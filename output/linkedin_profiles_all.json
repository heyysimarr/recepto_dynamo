I lead and manage well, I solve hard problems, and pick up dropped items before failure. I'm indemnity for DevOps, Information security, and DevSecOps engineering efforts.\n\nI am a friendly, purposefully generalized specialist whose focus is on Security, Automation, and system design while maintaining usability. I have almost 20 years in IT. I am a long time biohacker with an interest in accelerated learning and physical speed, minimized reaction time, sleep hacking and nootropics. My goals are to continue working in DevOps and Security Engineering, and eventually work in Space exploration projects(as the tech gets better).\n\nExtracurricular: Domestic Terraforming(gardening), Painting(acrylics and watercolors), Science-Fiction.",

Before attending MSU, I completed 84 college credits during high school, earning two associate degrees and two certificates alongside my high school diploma, demonstrating a strong foundation in academics and a drive for excellence.\n\nMy professional journey began with an internship at State Street Title Agency, where I gained exposure to business operations through order entry and pre-processing tasks. I have also developed a versatile skill set through roles such as a seasonal fulfillment specialist at Target and conservation work at Philmont Scout Ranch, both of which honed my ability to thrive in fast-paced and dynamic environments.\n\nAt MSU, I served as co-president of the Michigan State University Entrepreneurship Association (MSUEA) during my junior year. In this role, I helped cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset among students by organizing initiatives that foster innovation, collaboration, and practical business skills.\n\nIn addition to my academic and leadership experiences, I am the founder of TrailEagle Packs LLC, a startup focused on creating innovative outdoor gear. This venture aligns with my passion for business innovation and reflects my entrepreneurial vision. I am excited to continue leveraging the resources and opportunities at the Broad College of Business to grow as a leader and drive my venture forward.",
